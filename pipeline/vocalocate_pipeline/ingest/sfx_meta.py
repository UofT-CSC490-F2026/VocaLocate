"""A generic SFX dataset with a metadata CSV: references, extra candidate SFX and imitations.

This is the layout for datasets that come with semantic metadata (the
SFX_Metadata wish-list schema), such as the Vocal Imitation Set with its
same-class recordings or our synthetic demo set. Layout:

    metadata.csv with columns
        file, role, sound_id, imitates, category, tags, recording_id, description, imitator_id
    and optionally text_hint, hint_type; plus the audio files it lists (paths relative to the CSV).

* role is reference (a sound with imitations), library (an extra candidate SFX
  with no imitations, e.g. another take or a same-class recording), imitation, or
  unpaired_imitation (an imitation kept only as a training negative, such as a rejected
  or practice take: it gets its target's group key and split but never forms a pair).
* imitates is the sound_id of the reference an imitation imitates.
* tags are separated by ";".
* An imitation with a text_hint becomes a voice, text and target triple in the
  queries table, like the team recordings.
* recording_id groups clips cut from the same original recording. All clips of
  a recording, and the imitations of its reference, share a group key and so
  always land in the same split. A recording may have at most one reference.
