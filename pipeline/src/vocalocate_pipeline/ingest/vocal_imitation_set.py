"""Vocal Imitation Set v1.1 (Kim et al., DCASE 2018): 302 AudioSet classes, one imitated reference each.

github.com/interactiveaudiolab/VocalImitationSet (audio on Zenodo). Layout:

    original_recordings/reference/<file>        the 302 sounds that were imitated
    original_recordings/non_reference/<file>    other recordings of the same classes (~2,700)
    original_recordings_classes.txt             tab-separated: filename, classname, category_d1..d6,
                                                is_reference, multi_labeled
    original_recordings_license.csv             filename, ..., freesound_id
    vocal_imitations/included/<file>            5,601 imitations that raters accepted
    vocal_imitations.txt                        tab-separated: imitation_filename, reference_filename,
                                                included, participant_id,
                                                participants_sound_recording_description, ...
    participant_survey.csv                      optional: participant_id, age, gender,
                                                years_actively_using_music_tech,
                                                years_actively_making_music, ...

This is the real-data source for the mining demos. It maps onto the SFX_Metadata schema:

* category is the AudioSet class; tags are its ontology path (depth 1-6), so the
  metadata-guided miner gets real related pools: same class, then siblings that
  share ancestors. Same-class non-reference recordings are candidate SFX ("library"),
  the fine-grained distractors the dataset was built for.
* recording_id is the Freesound ID, so clips of one Freesound upload share a split.
* the imitator's own description of the sound becomes the text hint, a real
  voice + text + target triple for the CLAP branch.

Only `included` imitations form training pairs. Drafts, practice takes and imitations raters
rejected (`vocal_imitations/excluded/`) are kept as `unpaired_imitation` clips: they share their
target's group and split but never pair with it, so training can use them as negatives for
*other* sounds, the way the QVIM 2025 winner used VocalSketch's excluded imitations.

The participant survey fills part of the imitator profile (see `survey_imitators`). In
vocal_imitations.txt the participant IDs are rounded to six significant digits
(e.g. 5734240000000000.0), so survey rows are matched to them by the rounded value.
Nothing in the release records the microphone, the vocalization type, the participants'
first language or their consent terms.
